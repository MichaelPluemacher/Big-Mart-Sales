# Big-Mart-Sales

This is my contribution to the Big Mart Sales prediction competition at:

http://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/practice-problem-bigmart-sales-prediction

Given sales data for 1559 products across 10 stores of the Big Mart chain in various cities the task is to build a model to predict sales for each particular product in different stores.

The train and test data, which can be found at the link given above, contain the following variables:

| Variable | Description |
|----------|------------:|
| Item_Identifier | Unique product ID|
| Item_Weight | Weight of product |
| Item_Fat_Content | Whether the product is low fat or not|
| Item_Visibility | The % of total display area of all products in a store allocated to the particular product |
| Item_Type | The category to which the product belongs|
| Item_MRP | Maximum Retail Price (list price) of the product|
| Outlet_Identifier | Unique store ID |
| Outlet_Establishment_Year | The year in which store was established|
| Outlet_Size | The size of the store in terms of ground area covered|
| Outlet_Location_Type | The type of city in which the store is located|
| Outlet_Type | Whether the outlet is just a grocery store or some sort of supermarket|
| Item_Outlet_Sales| Sales of the product in the particulat store. This is the outcome variable to be predicted.|
